<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Relationship extraction systems which use dependency path are a very important part of modern NLP.
However, there are very few tools visualizing, exploring, and manually tuning the traning data used in these system.
REPC (Relation Extraction Path Cleaner) hopes to change that by prividing an intuitive and easy-to-use front-end
for doing so.

As an example, let's look at a relation extraction system that recently came out caled ICE. 
ICE is a very powerful system for automatically identifying and extracting relation information from arbitrari corpi. 
It is a very powerful and useful tool. 
One of the steps in ICE's pipeline is a process of manual tuning of the dependency paths which it uses to identify the relationships. This is the interface for doing so:

In order to label all paths extracted by the sstem, the user must inspect each path one-at-a-time - a very tedious process. 
Although ICE is good aat many things, this step is rather painful, and can be greatly improved upon.

<h2>About REPC</h2>
<p>
REPC attempts to make manual path cleansing a faster, more accurate, and more enjoyable process.

REPC represents all of the rules for determining a relationship with a prefix tree. 
Once the prefix tree is loaded, the user can traverse the tree by expanding + collapsing nodes, and re-rooting the tree.
Any node can be marked as positive (green), negative (bad), or yellow (unknown). 
If a non-leaf node is marked, all of its ancestor nodes will be marked as well.

<p>
Dr. Mihai Surdeanu had the initial inspiration, and privided much guidance during development.
Benjamin Dicken was the primary developer for the web application.
